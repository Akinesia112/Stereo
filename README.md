# Stereo
Mixed-Design in Music and Acoustic Power the Spatial Interaction Module for Field Experiences.
-
### This app and its interactive design were jointly developed by Shih-Yu Lai, Wen-Chen Chen, Yu-Ting Wu, Rui-Xia Xu, and Wan-Ting Hsieh.
This is a community sharing app that interacts with the environment through sound and vision. 
People's preferences for experiences mostly come from their current emotions, 
for example, preferring warm colors when happy and slow songs when sad.
Therefore, the first step in using Stereo is to capture the colors of the world through the camera lens. 
After analyzing the data, different types of tracks are generated on the map. At this point, 
people can pick and explore their favorite music objects through sound and vision. 
Users can participate in the music mixing process through sound effect processors and mixers, 
creating their own remix on the spot and sharing it on social media.
